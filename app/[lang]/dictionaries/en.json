    "description": "The Formula Student competition not only tests the performance of the car but also engineering knowledge and management skills. Participants are divided into classes depending on the type of car - electric (EV) or combustion (CV). In some editions, there is also the possibility to compete in the optional autonomous category (DV). The competition consists of several scored events, which are divided into static and dynamic. The team with the highest number of points out of a thousand possible is declared the winner of their class. The scoring method varies slightly between editions.",

    "description": "Students of Wrocław University of Science and Technology have always been among the most talented in all of Poland, and their desire to gain knowledge and experience is exceptional. To meet the needs of young constructors and managers, the PWR Racing Team was founded in 2009. Each season, we create a new racing car. We have twelve unique combustion car models to our credit, each of which can easily outperform the previous one. Last season, the team's first electric car with autonomous driving systems – RT12e – was created. We are currently working on our fourteenth car. In the 2016/2017 season, we showed what Poles are capable of. As the first Polish team, we won the entire Formula Student Italy competition. Since then, we have been among the best teams in the world ranking, holding the first place in Poland and the 11th place in the world in the 2021 season.",
